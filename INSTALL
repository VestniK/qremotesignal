Build from source

 * Requirements

To build QRemoteSignal you need to have:
1. Qt 4.5.0 library or later
2. QJson library (tested with svn snapshot)
3. scons build tool (tested with 1.2.0)
4. help2man utility (optional)

 * Build

On Unix-like systems go to the sources directory and run:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

NOTE: If the following error occurred when running cmake:
  Could not find module FindQJSON.cmake or a configuration file for package
  QJSON.

  Adjust CMAKE_MODULE_PATH to find FindQJSON.cmake or set QJSON_DIR to the
  directory containing a CMake configuration file for QJSON.  The file will
  have one of the following names:

you need to run cmake again with the flag -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH="path to FindQJSON.cmake"
for example on Ubuntu 10.04 with the qjson library from repository the following command
required:
$ cmake -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH="/usr/share/apps/cmake/modules" ..

On windows you can use cmake-gui to configure project

 * Install

After you've build the library run:

$ make install

to install it.

 * For developers

By default library will be built  without unit tests compilation and will run
doxygen each time you run make. The following configuration parameters are
recomended to build this library for work on its development:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DQRS_DOCS=False -DQRT_TEST=True ..
