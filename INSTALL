Build from source

 * Requirements

To build QRemoteSignal you need to have:
1. Qt 4.5.0 library or later
2. QJson library (tested with svn snapshot)
3. scons build tool (tested with 1.2.0)

 * Build

To build QRemoteSignal library, qrsc tool and unit tests run:
$ scons

NOTE: On windows you need to set correct path to Qt4 to QTDIR environment
variable and you need to use QJson argument to specify path to your QJson
installation:
$ scons QJson="C:\Program Files\qjson"

You need to specify path to QJson only once at first scons run since this
argument is cached

NOTE: If you have several Qt4 installations on POSIX system you should set
correct order of paths in PKG_CONFIG_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
varaibles. Usually you need to run the following commands:
$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${QTDIR}/lib/pkg-config:${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${QTDIR}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

 * Install

To install run:
$ scons prefix=<installation path> install

This will build qrsc and library and then install it to the location specified
by "prefix" value. If "prefix" argument is not specified library will be
installed to "/usr/local" on POSIX systems and to
"C:\Program Files\qremotesignal" on Windows.

You don't need to specify prefix every time since it's value cached. Specify it
when installing first time or if you want to change installation path.

 * Uninstall

To uninstall QRemoteSignal use the following command:
$ scons install -c

 * Additional parameters

There are several build arguments which you can use to customize QRemoteSignal
build and installation process. Use `scons --help` for detales. All of those
parameters are cached you don't need to specify them evry time.
